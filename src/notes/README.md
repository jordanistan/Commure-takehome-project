Being an application security engineer requires a combination of technical skills and an understanding of the security landscape. Here are some key areas you should focus on to become a great application security engineer:

* Security fundamentals: Familiarize yourself with the basics of security, including common attack types, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and security best practices such as the OWASP Top 10.

* Application security: Study the various security risks associated with web applications, including authentication and authorization, input validation, and session management. Learn about common security frameworks, such as the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), and how to apply them in practice.

* Secure coding practices: Learn how to write secure code, including coding techniques for preventing security vulnerabilities, such as input validation and error handling.

* Cryptography: Study cryptography concepts and algorithms, such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hash functions, and digital signatures.

* Web technologies: Familiarize yourself with the underlying technologies used in web applications, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the HTTP protocol.

* Cloud security: Learn about the security risks associated with cloud computing, such as data breaches, misconfigured services, and insecure APIs, and how to secure cloud deployments.

* Security testing: Study different types of security testing, including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and threat modeling, and learn how to perform and interpret the results of these tests.

* Security tools: Familiarize yourself with the most popular security tools and frameworks, such as OWASP ZAP, OWASP WebScarab, and Burp Suite, and learn how to use them effectively.

* Incident response: Learn about incident response and crisis management, including how to prepare for and respond to security incidents, such as data breaches and system failures.

* Legal and ethical issues: Study the legal and ethical implications of security, including data privacy regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and ethical hacking practices.

In addition to these technical skills, it's also important to cultivate a mindset of continuous learning, as the security landscape is constantly changing and evolving. Attend security conferences, read industry blogs and publications, and engage in online communities to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in application security.
