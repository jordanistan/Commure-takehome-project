Here are some code examples to help you understand common attack types and security best practices:

* SQL Injection: SQL injection is a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into a web application to manipulate the underlying database. To prevent SQL injection, it is important to validate user input and escape any special characters before using them in SQL queries.
Example in Python using the sqlite3 library:

```sql

import sqlite3

def fetch_data(username):
    # Open database connection
    conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")

    # Prepare SQL statement
    sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"

    # Execute SQL statement
    cursor = conn.execute(sql, (username,))

    # Fetch and return data
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

# Example usage
data = fetch_data("admin' OR 1=1 --")

In this example, if the user input is not properly validated, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code, such as "admin' OR 1=1 --", that would modify the SQL query and allow the attacker to bypass authentication and access sensitive data
