## Terraform 

Common Terraform commands with code examples and explanations of their uses:

## terraform init: 
Initializes a Terraform working directory by installing required provider plugins and configuring backend.

```bash
terraform init
```

## Explanation: This command is typically the first command that you run after writing your Terraform configuration. It initializes the working directory by installing the necessary plugins for the providers specified in the configuration and sets up the backend, which is responsible for managing the state of your infrastructure.

## terraform plan: 
Generates an execution plan that shows what Terraform will do when you run terraform apply.

```bash
terraform plan
```

## Explanation: This command generates an execution plan that shows the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure. You can review the plan to ensure that it contains the changes you expect before applying it.

## terraform apply: 

Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a Terraform plan.

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Explanation: This command applies the changes specified in your Terraform configuration to your infrastructure. It uses the execution plan generated by terraform plan to make the necessary changes.

## terraform show: 
Shows the state file in human-readable format.

```bash
terraform show
```

## Explanation: This command shows the current state of your infrastructure as stored in the state file. It is useful for reviewing the current state of your infrastructure and troubleshooting issues.

## terraform destroy: 
Destroys the Terraform-managed infrastructure.

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Explanation: This command destroys the infrastructure managed by Terraform. It removes all resources that were created by Terraform, and updates the state file to reflect the destruction.

## terraform fmt: 
Formats the Terraform code in the current directory* 

```bash
terraform fmt
```

## Explanation: This command automatically formats your Terraform code in the current directory. It makes sure that your code is consistent and easy to read.

## terraform output: 
Reads an output from a state file and prints its value.

```bash
terraform output example_output_variable
```

## Explanation: This command reads an output variable from the state file and prints its value. This can be useful for extracting information about your infrastructure, such as IP addresses or DNS names.

## terraform import:
Imports an existing infrastructure into Terraform.

```bash
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.example_bucket my-existing-bucket-name
```

## Explanation: This command imports an existing infrastructure into Terraform. It allows you to start managing an existing infrastructure with Terraform, by creating a Terraform state file that matches the current state of the infrastructure.

## terraform state:
Allows advanced state management, such as moving, merging and deleting state files.

```bash
terraform state mv aws_s3_bucket.example_bucket aws_s3_bucket.renamed_bucket
```

## Explanation: This command allows you to perform advanced state management, such as moving, merging and deleting state files. In this example, the command moves
